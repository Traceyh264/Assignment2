	<h1>The Practice</h1>
	<p>Brett Hoddle Consultants is a chartered accountancy practice in East Auckland, comprising of one person, Brett Hoddle. The practice doesn’t employ or intend to employ any staff, but if the need arose, assistance can be provided through another colleague. </p>

<p>The fundamental philosophy is to provide an extremely personalised service to meet the needs of each individual client. The person providing the advice is the one actually preparing and doing the job from start to finish.</p>
